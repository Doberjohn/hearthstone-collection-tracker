**FRONTEND**  
Frontend is working out of the box. Just clone the repo.

Backend is hosted in ./server folder. You need to run 'npm install'
to install dependecies and 'node index.js' to run server.

**DATABASE**  
You need to have MySQL Server 8.1 installed and MySQL workbench installed
for the database. Use the .dump file to import the data.
